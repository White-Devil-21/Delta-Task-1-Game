      <h1>PIANO TILE GAME</h1>
      <h2>This is a memory based game<br /></h2>
      <h2>The rules are very simple. A random tile will light up and you have to click it.
        If you click them successfully, then along with the previous round tiles another tile will light up. You can click the tiles in any order. If you failed to click all the tiles, then you will lose the game
         For each tile the maximum clicking time is 1.5 sec. If you take more time than that, you may lose.</h2>
